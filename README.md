This project enables the user to control an Arduino Car by using the android application with Bluetooth. Here, the user can remotely control the Arduino Car by connecting the Android mobile with the Bluetooth module of the car and make it move forward, reverse, forward-left, forward-right, reverse-left, reverse-right.

	The user can connect the android application with the Arduino Car with the specific Bluetooth module for which the MAC address of the module is given in the application. The user should pair the android device with the Bluetooth module and press the Connect to Bluetooth device button in the android application to initiate the connection with the module. The user can disconnect the Bluetooth module from the android device by again pressing the Connect to Bluetooth device button.

	The Arduino Car receives the signal and covey the signal to the DC motor through the motor shield and the signal is converted using the codes given in the Arduino UNO. The codes are given to the Arduino UNO by using the software Arduino.
